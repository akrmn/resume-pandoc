# Summary

I am a creative functional programmer. I have a strong Haskell background of over
three years in industry plus three years in university.
I advocate for strongly-typed solutions, and I believe that type systems like
Haskell's are an excellent tool to reason about the code we write.
I enjoy writing thorough and concise documentation, as well as property-based test
suites using \texttt{QuickCheck} or \texttt{hedgehog}. My passion for functional
programming means that I find pleasure in teaching and training other developers.

# Work Experience

## Klarna Bank AB

Software Developer; November 2019 - Ongoing; Stockholm, Sweden; Full-time

I have designed and built multiple micro-services which serve as the backbone of Klarna’s payments infrastructure, using GHC Haskell together with AWS components. I have built integrations with external services using libraries such as \texttt{servant} and \texttt{servant-client}. I have also introduced my colleagues from non-functional programming backgrounds to Haskell concepts, patterns and best practices.

## Standard Chartered Bank - Strats Team

Quantitative Developer; June 2017 - October 2019; London, UK; Full-time

I designed and developed various internal use applications and services for managing and pricing financial instruments and generating daily reports, using both GHC Haskell and Mu, an in-house finance-tailored dialect of Haskell, as well as an in-house solution for deploying those services across clusters of hosts.

## Brandcrumb

Software Developer; March 2017 - May 2017; Madrid, Spain; Full-time

I built and tested RESTful APIs in Java and Haskell, deployed projects using Docker and Amazon Web Service - Elastic Compute Cloud, improved upon Prestashop and Magento payment methods, and designed components for Android and iOS applications using Visual Studio with Xamarin.

## ComeWith Inc.

Android Developer; October 2015 - March 2016; Remote; Part-time

I designed and developed ComeWith Inc’s app, Surge, for Android, as well as its backend, using Android Studio and various APIs to interact with remote services such as Parse and Layer. Later, I was responsible for migrating the backend to Amazon Web Services due to Parse’s closure.

-   GPA
    : 96%

-   Relevant Modules
    : Programming Languages, Compilers and Interpreters, Database Management

-   Experience
    : \phantom{ }
    -   Teaching Assistant for the _Introduction to Computer Science_ and
      _Compilers and Interpreters_ modules.
    -   Academic Exchange at KTH, Stockholm, Sweden, taking modules in Machine Learning, Internet Security and Logic Programming

-   Degree Project
    : Pointers and Abstract Data Types for Graciela

    I designed an extension to the programming language Graciela, based on E. W. Dijkstra’s GCL, with assertions verified at runtime and allowing for the definition of ADTs. I developed the corresponding extension to its compiler, taking advantage of Haskell and its libraries, including \texttt{lens}, \texttt{megaparsec}, \texttt{llvm} and \texttt{QuickCheck}. This project was awarded “Outstanding Recognition”  and used in the practical courses at Universidad Simón Bolívar.
